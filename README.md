# Microsoft Caboodle

Microsoft Caboodle gives developers essential cross-platform APIs for their mobile applications. 

iOS, Android, and UWP offer unique operating system and platform APIs that developers have access to all in C# leveraging Xamarin. It is great that developers have 100% API access in C# with Xamarin, but these APIs are different per platform. This means developers have to learn three different APIs to access platform specific features. With Caboodle developers have a single cross-platform API that works with any iOS, Android, or UWP application that can be accessed from shared code no matter how the user interface is created.
